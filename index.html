        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello all, my name is Arshleen Toor and I am currently a first-year pursuing a degree in Business Administration at the University of California, Riverside. I hope to solidify skills I learn as a business student such as communication, teamwork, leadership, problem-solving, etc. through experiences that will allow me to apply these skills in the real world. 
<br><br>

        My professional experiences involve various volunteering opportunities. An organization I have been involved in for the longest period of time is Gurdwara Guru Angad Darbar, the church I attend in my community. I am a part of the seva (service) team that cleans parts of the temple and cooks langar (free lunch, dinner, tea) for temple members on busy weekends. Additionally I was a content creator for the organization entitled, Educationist Tutoring, whose goal was to provide tutoring services to children in India for free. As a content creator, I created condensed notes, presentations, and worksheets that were catered to fit the needs of each student. Furthermore, in high school I was a volunteer for the Spanish Honor Society and National Honor Society. In Spanish Honor Society my responsibilities were to tutor students struggling in their Spanish courses, volunteer in spanish-speaking communities, participate in events such as donation drives, and create thank you cards for teachers and healthcare professionals for their hard work and endurance amidst the pandemic. As a member of the National Honor Society, my responsibilities were to participate in volunteer activities in my community, tutor students in various subjects, assist in organizing events such as donation drives, marathons/runs/walks, Adopt a Star, and toy drives. Additionally I volunteered in a cultural club called Jakara Movement, whose mission is to educate the Punjabi youth community about our culture, language, and values. As a volunteer for this organization, I participated in events where we cleaned the outsides of local gurdwaras (sikh temples), raised 2k in donations to fund renovations for older gurdwaras in the city. 
<br><br>

        As a current student at the University of California, Riverside and being enrolled in courses such as Introduction to Business and Introduction to Computing I have expanded my teamwork, communication, as well as leadership skills through team projects. Instances such as group members not responding or attending meetings allowed me to learn how to resolve issues in a peaceful and non-confrontational manner. Although there weren’t assigned leaders in the group project, I had learned how to communicate and lead the group. With the pandemic and online classes, breakout rooms are not the optimal place to make connections with fellow peers in classes. Due to this many students join the breakout groups but avoid unmuting and turning on their mics, but for projects that involve points it is important that someone takes the lead and starts the conversation so that everyone else can become comfortable with speaking up. As a result of being the first person to speak up and spark conversations about different group projects, I often became the unofficial leader of the group and was able to develop my leadership skills.
